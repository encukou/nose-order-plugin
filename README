Nose order plugin

This plugin allows methods in Nose test classes to run in the order they are
defined, rather than alphabetically.

Note that it is bad practice to rely on test order. If you can avoid it, do so;
otherwise this plugin is for you.

INSTALLATION

From PyPI: pip install nose_order_plugin
From source: setup.py install

USAGE

- Mark the test class with the nose_order_plugin.ordered decorator
- Pass the --with-ordered-tests option to Nose

CAVEATS

- Only plain classes may be ordered. Classes deriving from unittest.TestCase
  are incompatible with this plugin.
- The plugin looks at source code lines for ordering; if the methods are not
  defined in a single file (or other magic is used), the ordering might not be
  precise.
- Test generators are not supported -- they might work, but they're untested.
